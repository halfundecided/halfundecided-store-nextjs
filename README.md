## NextJS
- [x] NextJS? 
  + **React framework** with the specific rules 
- [x] Difference between NextJS and CRA (create-react-app)
  + creating react app using Next framwork and automatically call a server (which is a server for the front-end. interesting!)
  + Next runs on a server 
- [x] **Server-side rendering?**
  + The website rendered on the server 
  + i.e. no blank page or loading massege when we refresh a page 
  + <-> Client-side rendering
  + Next: 데이터들이 렌더 되기 전에 서버가 모든 데이터를 수집하고 plain html로 보여줌 = page가 back-end에서 생성된다. 
  + Old react: small amount of html with js file (when this js file loaded on the client, it will quickly create the page)
  + **does not change the page until the page has data** --> Goal!
- [x] Creating a NextJS App
  + `yarn init`
  + `yarn add react react-dom next`
  + `yarn dev` 
  + rendered it on the back-end first, and then copy HTML and send it to the client (the front-end)
- [x] Links and Navigation
  + Nextjs has their own linking and routing systems
- [x] Shared Components 
- [ ] Dynamic Pages
